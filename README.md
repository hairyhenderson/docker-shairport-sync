[shairport-sync](https://github.com/mikebrady/shairport-sync) is an Apple AirPlay receiver. It can receive audio directly from iOS devices, iTunes, etc. Multiple instances of shairport-sync will stay in sync with each other and other AirPlay devices when used with a compatible multi-room player, such as iTunes or [forked-daapd](https://github.com/jasonmc/forked-daapd).

## Run

    docker run -d \
        --net host \
        --device /dev/snd \
        -e AIRPLAY_NAME=Docker \
        hairyhenderson/shairport-sync

### Parameters

* `--net host` must be run in host mode
* `--device /dev/snd` share host alsa system with container. Does not require `--privileged` as `-v /dev/snd:/dev/snd` would
* `-e AIRPLAY_NAME=Docker` set the AirPlay device name. Defaults to Docker
* extra arguments will be passed to shairplay-sync (try `-- help`)
